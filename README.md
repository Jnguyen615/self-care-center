# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I built a functional website that will give different mantra's and affirmations to help people struggling with self worth, self confidence and even more. These quotes can help people immensely and to be honest, they are helping me currenlty as I am struggling. Creating something to help others gives me great pride. I see the problem being centered around people who are struggling and this app can increase self worth and confidence just by these motivational quotes.  

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

To get this app running, you need to go to https://github.com/Jnguyen615/self-care-center, fork the project and then clone it to your machine using the SSH code and git clone. Type git clone + the SSH key to get a copy of the project on your local machine. From there you can open the page by typing open index.html, which will pull up the page on the browser. Then you will be able to navigate through the page, selecting mantras or affirmations to appear on the screen. You can enjoy seeing the messages and thinking about how they relate to your life or how you can use them in your life to make it better.
